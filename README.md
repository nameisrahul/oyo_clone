## Project Overview:
The OYO Clone Django Project aims to replicate the functionalities of the popular hotel booking platform OYO, providing users with a seamless experience for discovering, booking, and managing hotel accommodations. Leveraging the Django framework, this project will focus on delivering a robust and scalable web application tailored to meet the needs of modern travelers.

2. Hotel Listings:
   - The application will showcase a comprehensive list of hotels, including details such as location, amenities, room types, and pricing. Users can filter and search for hotels based on their preferences, such as location, price range, and rating.


3. Booking Management:
   - Once users find their desired hotel, they can proceed to book rooms seamlessly through the platform. The application will facilitate the selection of room types, booking dates, and any additional services, providing a smooth booking experience.
4. Confirmation and Notifications:
   - Upon successful booking, users will receive instant confirmation of their reservations via email or SMS. Additionally, they will receive notifications regarding booking updates, such as payment confirmation, check-in details, and other relevant information.
